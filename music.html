    <!--list of barque composers (literally only bach)-->
    <ol class='body' id='music_body'>
        <li><b>J.S. Bach (1685-1750): </b> Bach is a household name even
        in the twenty-first century. Although he did not have
        Access to the modern piano, many of his keyboard works
        written for earlier keyboard instruments like clavichord
        or harpsichord are staples for modern piano repertoire.
        Bach is extremely famous for his use of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint' class='links' id='music_links'>counterpoint</a>.
        The works I listen to most are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Goldberg Variations, BWV 998: </b>Particularly the famous
                     <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuY20YN6F4k' class='links' id='music_links'>1981 Glenn Gould recording</a>. The legend around the origin of this piece is that Bach was commissioned to write the
                     work by a nobleman who had sleeping problems. The idea was that he would lie down
                    and have his harpsichordist play these variations for him when he couldn't sleep.
                </li>
                <li><b>Well-Tempered Clavier (Books I & II), BWV 846-893: </b>Another landmark work from Bach, which was
                    meant to show that music could be played in all of the keys without sounding out of tune. The work contains
                    48 pairs of preludes/fugues for a total of 96 pieces of music. Some of my favorites are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(Book I):</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Fugue No. 5 in D Major, BWV 850</li>
                                <li>Fugue No. 8 in D-Sharp Minor, BWV 853</li>
                                <li>Prelude No. 9 in E Major, BWV 854</li>
                                <li>Prelude No. 10 in E Minor, BWV 855</li>
                                <li>Prelude No. 17 A-Flat Major, 862</b></li>
                            </ul>

        <p class='body' id='music_body'>The classical era was my first
            serious introduction to classical music. It is the era that starts to see
            more emphasis on expression (due to figures like Beethoven), but still
            prioritized a consistency in style and form.

        <li><b>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): </b> An absolute staple in 
            classical music history--probablythe most famous composer of all
            time. Apparently he was quite a moody fellow, and was easily irritated.
            He was well-known for playing the piano with great expression and would
            often break the strings on the pianos he played. Maybe partly due to this
            former fact, later in life he began to lose his hearing. Instead of giving 
            up on music,he took the legs off his pinao, set it on the ground, and played
            by feeling the vibrations of the notes.
            A couple of famous pieces:
                <ul>
                    <li>Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor: Arguably his most recognizable
                        piano sonata, the classic 'Moonlight Sonata.' Interestingly, the name
                        was not given by Beethoven himself,
                        but by a German music critic and poet named Ludwig Rellstab in 1832. He
                        compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon 
                        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne' class='links' id='music_links'>Lake Lucerne</a> 
                        (a lake in Switzerland). The first movement of this sonata was the first
                        piece I learned to play on the piano. The second movement is often
                        underappreciated, but I think it is really beautiful too.

    <!--Introduce the romantic era-->
    <p id='music_header'>Romantic Era (1820-1900)</p>
        <p class='body' id='music_body'>The romantic era is
            where most of my listening takes place. I think a lot of this has to do with the
            fact that this is the era wherein the modern piano matured.

            <li><b>John Field (1782-1837): </b> John Field was an Irish pianist prodigy from the early
                romantic period. He is mostly known for innovating the nocturne, a composition genre
                that would later be perfected by Chopin. Field was highly praised for his piano playing
                during his lifetime, and was considered the be one of the best amongst contemporary
                musicians/composers. Muzio Clementi, a composer who was also one of the early piano
                manufacturers, used Field to market and sell his pianos. I have only listened to Field's
                nocturnes. Here is a good sampling:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nocturne No. 1 in E-Flat Major, H. 24: </b> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L3HqFiNuu8' id='music_links'>Recording</a> from Alice Sara Ott.</li>
                    <li><b>Nocturne No. 4 in A Major, H. 36: </b> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVUPH1J7iE4&list=PL2qQXyLK4-1W9cBXZDNnGxO8jNS_rZoXS&index=4' id='music_links'>Recording</a> from Alice Sara Ott.</li>

        <ol class='body' id='music_body'>
            <li><b>Johannes Brahms (1833-1897): </b> Brahms is a shining figure from the romantic era, and made great use of the modern piano. Brahms was
                very close with the Schumann's and lived with them at one point. He remained close to Clara afer Robert's death, and there has been 
                much speculation as to whether or not there was something of a romance between them. However, I believe the popular opinion is that they
                were simply very close friends.

    <center><img src ='photos/chopin.jpeg' class='composer_portraits' alt='portrait of chopin'><center>
    <ol class ='body' id='music_body'>
        <li><b>Frederic Chopin (1810-1849): </b> Chopin is without a doubt
            the composer I have listened to most in my life, and I really do not
            care if this is cliche or whatever else. Overall, I have never encountered
            another composer whose music <i>consistently</i> invokes as powerful of emotions
            as I experience when listening to almost any of Chopin's music.
            I'm going to try and present a good 'introduction' to Chopin's
            music here:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Nocturne No. 13 in C Minor (Op. 48, No. 1): </b>Chopin is particularly famous
                    for his nocturnes, and this is probably my favorite of them.
                    It's beautiful, and there is a wonderful building up and subsequent
                    crashing down around the middle (a display which
                    interestingly enough does not follow standard nocturne form). I've never heard anything
                    like it, and the 'toppling of the musical tower' is <i>very</i> charged emotionally.
