        <!--Medieval music-->
        <p class='header'>Medieval Era (500-1400 CE)</p>
            <p class='body' class='body'>Medieval music evolved from simple monophonic Gregorian chant, 
                performed without instruments in early Christian churches, to increasingly complex forms including organum (parallel melodies), 
                conductus (processional songs), and eventually the polyphonic motet which combined multiple independent vocal lines with different texts. 
                By the late medieval period, instrumental music had become more prominent both in sacred 
                settings and in secular contexts, where troubadours and trouvères performed on instruments like the rebec, psaltery, and harp, often accompanying songs 
                about courtly love and heroic deeds.</p>

                <li><b>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750): </b> Bach is a household name even
                in the twenty-first century. Although he did not have
                Access to the modern piano, many of his keyboard works
                written for earlier keyboard instruments like clavichord
                or harpsichord are staples for modern piano repertoire.
                Bach is extremely famous for his use of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint' class='links' class='links'>counterpoint</a>.
                The works I listen to most are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Goldberg Variations, BWV 998: </b>Particularly the famous
                            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuY20YN6F4k' class='links' class='links'>1981 Glenn Gould recording</a>. The legend around the origin of this piece is that Bach was commissioned to write the
                            work by a nobleman who had sleeping problems. The idea was that he would lie down
                            and have his harpsichordist play these variations for him when he couldn't sleep.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Well-Tempered Clavier (Books I & II), BWV 846-893: </b>Another landmark work from Bach, which was
                            meant to show that music could be played in all of the keys without sounding out of tune. The work contains
                            48 pairs of preludes/fugues for a total of 96 pieces of music. Some of my favorites are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>(Book I):</li>

                        <li><b>Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 645: </b>I just recently heard this piece for the first time, played
                            on piano by Murray Perahia. When I first heard it, my thought was 'If Chopin made beauty through emotion, 
                            Bach made it through structural perfection.' Here is the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0__Mx86_Hxc' class='links' class='links'>recording</a> that introduced me to the piece.

                prioritized a consistency in style and form.

                    <li><b>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): </b> An absolute staple in 
                        classical music history--probablythe most famous composer of all
                        time. Apparently he was quite a moody fellow, and was easily irritated.
                        He was well-known for playing the piano with great expression and would
                        often break the strings on the pianos he played. Maybe partly due to this
                        former fact, later in life he began to lose his hearing. Instead of giving 
                        up on music,he took the legs off his pinao, set it on the ground, and played
                        by feeling the vibrations of the notes.
                        A couple of famous pieces:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor, Op. 27/2: </b>Arguably his most recognizable
                                piano sonata, the classic 'Moonlight Sonata.' Interestingly, the name
                                was not given by Beethoven himself,
                                but by a German music critic and poet named Ludwig Rellstab in 1832. He
                                compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon 
                                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne' class='links' class='links'>Lake Lucerne</a> 
                                (a lake in Switzerland). The first movement of this sonata was the first
                                piece I learned to play on the piano. The second movement is often
                                underappreciated, but I think it is really beautiful too.

                    <li><b>Carl Phillip Emmanuel Bach (1714-1788): </b>While he was his own man, he is inescapably J.S. Bach's son. He was one of the composers
                    that aided the transition from the Baroque to the Classical era.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>12 Variations über die Folie d'Espagne, H. 263: </b>Very touching, reflective, and powerful where it needs to be. My favorite recording is from Shani Diluka,
                            but I cannot find a video of it on YouTube. Instead, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEyIj0vy6c' class='links'>this one from Ana-Marija Markovina</a> will have to suffice. It's okay, but it doesn't capture the same mood.</li>
                            <li><b>Die Israeliten in der Wüste, H. 775 / Erster Teil: 1. 'Die Zunge klebt am dürren Gaumen': </b>Beautiful voices in this piece. The translation for the voices is quite grim:<br>
                            <i>'Our mouths are parched<br>
                            we can scarcely breathe<br>
                            God, do you not hear<br>
                            the complaint of woe, you turn<br>

                    <li><b>Wolfang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791): </b> Mozart possessed exceptional mental composition abilities and could work out 
                        complex pieces in his head before writing them down. Mozart's era did view musical talent as a divine gift, and composing without 
                        instruments was seen as evidence of exceptional ability--however, this didn't establish mental composition as standard practice for all composers.
                        Personality-wise, Mozart was free-spirited and rebellious; his personality is shown wonderfully in the 1984 movie <i>Amadeus</i>. Here are some pieces:
                    </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b><i>Don Giovanni (K. 527): </b></i> This is the only opera I have watched/listened to all the way through. I learned about it because
                                Kierkeegard talks about it <i>a lot</i> in <i>Either/Or</i>, so I gave it a watch. Honestly, none of the pieces from the opera stuck out to
                                me, but it's good to know of for the lore's sake. Frankly, I'm not the biggest fan of opera.</li>
                            <li><b>Piano Concerto No. 27 in B-Flat Major, K. 595: II. Larghetto: </b>This piece is nice. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIuJh2V3SrQ' class='links'>Here

                            <li><b>Serenade No. 13 in G Major, K. 525 'Eine kleine Nachtmusik' II. Romanze: </b>The first movement of this piece is very popular, and you have probably heard it before.
                            However, I would guess that you have not heard the second movement, and it is equally wonderful! <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RndYJGgqE7U'class='links'>Here is a

                    <li><b>Franz Schubert (1797-1828): </b>Schubert could be placed in either the classical era or romantic. He is commonly considered
                    as the 'last classical composer' and the 'first romantic composer'. Regardless, I threw him in the classical era. He has a crazy
                    amount of works (over 1,000), and I have not come close to listening to all of them. His collection of works is more impressive
                    when you consider the fact that he was only 31 years old when he died of syphilis. Here are some of my favorites from him: </li>

                                yet confident and carries with a good pace. The melody in the right hand is slower, more contemplative, almost as thought
                                it were trying to convince the left hand to adopt its tempo. Honestly, it's so beautiful, and full of emotion. I think

            <p class='body' class='body'>The romantic era is
                where most of my listening takes place. I think a lot of this has to do with the
                fact that this is the era wherein the modern piano matured.

                    <li><b>Franz Liszt (1811-1886):</b> The first rockstar in music. Liszt was an absolute phenomenon--he was both an unparalleled virtuoso
                        at the piano and also extremely popular with the ladies. They would travel all around to watch him perform. No one had really
                        experienced this level of stardom before, and it is definitely an important piece of music history. It is often argued that Liszt
                        focused more on the act of playing the piano in his music (e.g., composing extremely hard passages for the piano, knowing he would be one of
                        the few that could actually play it) as opposed to embracing true musical expression. This has kind of turned me off to his music, although
                        apparently he turned his attention more to the quality of the music in his later years. </li>

                        very close with the Schumann's and lived with them at one point. He remained close to Clara afer Robert's death, and there has been 
                        much speculation as to whether or not there was something of a romance between them. However, I believe the popular opinion is that they
                        were simply very close friends:

                        romantic period. He is mostly known for innovating the nocturne, a composition genre
                        that would later be perfected by Chopin. Field was highly praised for his piano playing
                        during his lifetime, and was considered the be one of the best amongst contemporary
                        musicians/composers. Muzio Clementi, a composer who was also one of the early piano
                        manufacturers, used Field to market and sell his pianos. I have only listened to Field's
                        nocturnes. Here is a good sampling:

                <li><b>Frederic Chopin (1810-1849): </b> Chopin is without a doubt
                    the composer I have listened to most in my life, and I really do not
                    care if this is cliche or whatever else. Overall, I have never encountered
                    another composer whose music <i>consistently</i> invokes as powerful of emotions
                    as I experience when listening to almost any of Chopin's music.
                    I'm going to try and present a good 'introduction' to Chopin's
                    music here:
                </li>

                        <li><b>Nocturne No. 13 in C Minor (Op. 48, No. 1): </b>Chopin is particularly famous
                            for his nocturnes, and this is probably my favorite of them.
                            It's beautiful, and there is a wonderful building up and subsequent
                            crashing down around the middle (a display which
                            interestingly enough does not follow standard nocturne form). I've never heard anything
                            like it, and the 'toppling of the musical tower' is <i>very</i> charged emotionally.
