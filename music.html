            <li><b>J.S. Bach (1685-1750): </b> Bach is a household name even
            in the twenty-first century. Although he did not have
            Access to the modern piano, many of his keyboard works
            written for earlier keyboard instruments like clavichord
            or harpsichord are staples for modern piano repertoire.
            Bach is extremely famous for his use of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint' class='links' id='music_links'>counterpoint</a>.
            The works I listen to most are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Goldberg Variations, BWV 998: </b>Particularly the famous
                        <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuY20YN6F4k' class='links' id='music_links'>1981 Glenn Gould recording</a>. The legend around the origin of this piece is that Bach was commissioned to write the
                        work by a nobleman who had sleeping problems. The idea was that he would lie down
                        and have his harpsichordist play these variations for him when he couldn't sleep.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Well-Tempered Clavier (Books I & II), BWV 846-893: </b>Another landmark work from Bach, which was
                        meant to show that music could be played in all of the keys without sounding out of tune. The work contains
                        48 pairs of preludes/fugues for a total of 96 pieces of music. Some of my favorites are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>(Book I):</li>
                                <ul>

        <p class='body' id='music_body'>The classical era was my first
            serious introduction to classical music. It is the era that starts to see
            more emphasis on expression (due to figures like Beethoven), but still
            prioritized a consistency in style and form.

                <li><b>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): </b> An absolute staple in 
                    classical music history--probablythe most famous composer of all
                    time. Apparently he was quite a moody fellow, and was easily irritated.
                    He was well-known for playing the piano with great expression and would
                    often break the strings on the pianos he played. Maybe partly due to this
                    former fact, later in life he began to lose his hearing. Instead of giving 
                    up on music,he took the legs off his pinao, set it on the ground, and played
                    by feeling the vibrations of the notes.
                    A couple of famous pieces:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor: Arguably his most recognizable
                            piano sonata, the classic 'Moonlight Sonata.' Interestingly, the name
                            was not given by Beethoven himself,
                            but by a German music critic and poet named Ludwig Rellstab in 1832. He
                            compared the first movement to moonlight shining upon 
                            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne' class='links' id='music_links'>Lake Lucerne</a> 
                            (a lake in Switzerland). The first movement of this sonata was the first
                            piece I learned to play on the piano. The second movement is often
                            underappreciated, but I think it is really beautiful too.
                            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJHNufol8Q' id='music_links'>Here is a performance of this piece played by Daniel Barenboim.</a>

                <li><b>Franz Schubert (1797-1828): </b>Schubert could be placed in either the classical era or romantic. He is commonly considered
                as the 'last classical composer' and the 'first romantic composer'. Regardless, I threw him in the classical era. He has a crazy
                amount of works (over 1,000), and I have not come close to listening to all of them. His collection of works is more impressive
                when you consider the fact that he was only 31 years old when he died of syphilis. Here are some of my favorites from him: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Piano Sonata No. 21 in B-Flat Major, D. 960: </b>The last of his piano sonatas. I love the mood and melodies in this sonata.
                            My <a href='https://music.apple.com/us/album/piano-sonata-in-b-flat-major-d-960-i-molto-moderato-live/1593676666?i=1593676671' id='music_links'>favorite performance</a> is from the Russian pianist Sviatoslav Ritcher. He approaches the piece with such patience in this recording,
                            and it is so wonderful to listen to. Many other pianists rush through this piece.</li>
                        <li><b> 3 Klavierstücke, No. 1, D. 946: </b> in opposition to the first piece, this one has a faster pace.
                            It makes me think of a bunch of guys on horses racing or something. My <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aREDWWXhBdc' id='music_links'>favorite recording</a> is from 
                            Grigory Sokolov. </li>
                        <li><b>Impromptu No. 3 in G-Flat Major, D. 899: </b> This piece is so beautiful. The rhythm in the left hand is gentle
                            yet confident and carries with a good pace. The melody in the right hand is slower, more contemplative, almost as thought
                            it were trying to convince the left hand to adopt its tempo. Honestly, it's so beautiful, and full of emotion. I think
                            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUp2u9wI1fY' id='music_links'>Khatia Buniatishvili played it best</a>.

        <p class='body' id='music_body'>The romantic era is
            where most of my listening takes place. I think a lot of this has to do with the
            fact that this is the era wherein the modern piano matured.

                    very close with the Schumann's and lived with them at one point. He remained close to Clara afer Robert's death, and there has been 
                    much speculation as to whether or not there was something of a romance between them. However, I believe the popular opinion is that they
                    were simply very close friends:

                <li><b>John Field (1782-1837): </b> John Field was an Irish pianist prodigy from the early
                    romantic period. He is mostly known for innovating the nocturne, a composition genre
                    that would later be perfected by Chopin. Field was highly praised for his piano playing
                    during his lifetime, and was considered the be one of the best amongst contemporary
                    musicians/composers. Muzio Clementi, a composer who was also one of the early piano
                    manufacturers, used Field to market and sell his pianos. I have only listened to Field's
                    nocturnes. Here is a good sampling:

            <li><b>Frederic Chopin (1810-1849): </b> Chopin is without a doubt
                the composer I have listened to most in my life, and I really do not
                care if this is cliche or whatever else. Overall, I have never encountered
                another composer whose music <i>consistently</i> invokes as powerful of emotions
                as I experience when listening to almost any of Chopin's music.
                I'm going to try and present a good 'introduction' to Chopin's
                music here:
            </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nocturne No. 13 in C Minor (Op. 48, No. 1): </b>Chopin is particularly famous
                        for his nocturnes, and this is probably my favorite of them.
                        It's beautiful, and there is a wonderful building up and subsequent
                        crashing down around the middle (a display which
                        interestingly enough does not follow standard nocturne form). I've never heard anything
                        like it, and the 'toppling of the musical tower' is <i>very</i> charged emotionally.
