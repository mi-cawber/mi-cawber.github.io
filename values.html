            <p class='header'>Self-Trust</p>
                <p class='body'>Those of us born after the inventing of the internet are able to search things up whenever we want. Additionally, social media sites are full of people giving answers to all kinds of questions regarding morality, science, virtue, right and wrong, etc. Whenever you are faced with a problem of any kind, try to think through it yourself before looking things up on the internet. You are capable of more than you think, and this practice will allow you to build trust with yourself.</p>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>Embrace Failure</p>
                <p class='body'>Failure is absolutely necessary and isn't something to be feared. It's an opportunity to improve and learn.</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>Appreciate Life</p>
                <p class='body'>At once, life seems to take <i>forever</i> and also fly by very fast. It has made me think about the inevitability of aging. It has made me think about the times when I have seen people in late adulthood who have spent their entire lives going through the motions. It is easy to think, "Well I'm glad that isn't me." But life is indifferent, and that could become any one of us. We only get one shot down here on Earth, and we don't know how long we will be here. Make it count!</p>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>Relationships</p>
                <p class='body'>There are fewer things more precious than developing meaningful bonds with the people in your daily life. For many years, I didn't understand what it meant to put real, <i>focused</i> effort into such relationships, and changing this has been rewarding.</p>
            </div>


            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>Curiosity</p>
                <p class='body'>An inexhaustible reservoir of curiosity is what I believe people refer to when they preach about "keeping your youth," or "remaining as a child in adulthood." There is something so freeing about <i>never</i> being done with learning new things.</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>Optimism</p>
                <p class='body'>Having the ability to summon an optimistic view in the most unpleasant situations is a superpower.</p>
