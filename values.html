            <!--number one-->
            <p class='header'>1. Everyone Is Remarkable</p>
                <p class='body'>Without a doubt, you can learn something from every human being you meet in your life, if you really try. Everyone has something of value to say or add. Avoid classifying people as "too stupid" or "too smart" or too this or too that. <i>We are all human beings</i>, and I think often times we forget how deep the implications of this fact are.</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <!--number two-->
            <p class='header'>2. Embrace Loved Ones</p>
                <p class='body'>There seems to be fewer things more precious in life than developing meaningful bonds with the people in your daily life. For many years, I didn't understand what it meant to put real, <i>focused</i> effort into these relationships. I just assumed they happened or they didn't.</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <!--number three-->
            <p class='header'>3. Enjoy The Moment</p>
                <p class='body'>At once, life seems to both take <i>forever</i> and fly by at breakneck speeds. It has made me think about the inevitability of aging. It has made me think about the times when I have seen people in late adulthood who have spent their entire lives going through the motions. It is easy to think, "Well I'm glad that isn't me." But life is indifferent, and that could become any one of us. We only get one shot down here on Earth, so make it count. Look at the sky every once in awhile!</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <!--number four-->
            <p class='header'>4. Be Curious</p>
                <p class='body'>An inexhaustible reservoir of curiosity is what I believe people refer to when they preach about "keeping your youth," or "remaining as a child in adulthood." There is something so freeing about <i>never</i> being done with learning new things.</p>
            </div>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <!--number five-->
            <p class='header'>5. Don't Fear Failure</p>
                <p class='body'>This is closely related with the former point. If someone finds the time, I would encourage them to sit down and think about the pros and cons of either choosing a life of safety or choosing a life of risk and adventure. The simple fact is, <i>no matter which path you choose, you're going to die anyway</i>. So why the heck would you play it safe and boring, if it won't save you in the end? Of course I think this mindset sort of changes once one becomes married and has children. But, I think as young single person, you should try to fail as much as possible; you learn a hell of a lot about yourself and what you're capable of along the way.</p>

            <!--number six-->
            <p class='header'>6. Optimism</p>
                <p class='body'>A simple truth is that the world we live in is very cruel and unfair. However, it is best if we worry about the things we can directly influence. We may come to learn that we can change a lot more than we think. Having the ability to summon an optimistic view in the most critical situations is a superpower.</p>

            <div style='margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px'>
            <p class='header'>7. Trust Yourself</p>
                <p class='body'>Those of us born after the inventing of the internet are able to search things up whenever we want. Additionally, social media sites are full of people giving answers to all kinds of questions regarding morality, science, virtue, right and wrong, etc. Whenever you are faced with a problem of any kind, try to think through it yourself before looking things up on the internet. You are capable of more than you think, and this practice will allow you to build trust with yourself.</p>
