            I was not one of those kids who always had their nose in a book. As a matter of fact,
            I hardly ever had my nose anywhere near a book. I was too busy playing video games or running
            around outside. The first social media sites came into existence when I was around 9-10 years old, and before
            this flash-based computer games were booming. So, these sorts of recreational endeavors consumed much of my time
            as a young person.
            <br><br>
            I started seriously reading once I hit adulthood.

    <h2 class='header' id='book_header' style="text-align: left;">Here are some of my favorite books: </h2>

        <!--entry for David Copperfield-->
        <center><img src='photos/david_copperfield.jpg' id='book_cover'><center>
            <p id='books_subhead'><i>David Copperfield</i></p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Author: Charles Dickens</p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Published: 1850</p>
            <p id='book_body'>I was initially intimidated by this book because
                it is 765 pages (as a rule, I tend to doubt if I will finish a book
                if it is over 400 pages). However, I was instantly swept away by writing
                style of Charles Dickens. The time period of this novel, the language
                he uses, and his humorous style really got to me. This book has some of the 
                most memorable characters I have ever encountered. :] I consider this
                my favorite novel of all time--absolute classic.
            </p>

        <!--entry for the catcher in the rye-->
        <center><img src='photos/catcher.jpg' id='book_cover'><center>
            <p id='books_subhead'><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i></p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Author: J.D. Salinger</p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Published: 1951</p>
            <p id='book_body'>This book is fairly short, only coming in ~236 pages. This was the first
                work from J.D. Salinger that I had read, and I <i>immediately</i> fell in love. I read this
                before David Copperfield, and I considered <i>this</i> as my favorite novel for the longest
                time. This is good gateway to Salinger, and it led me to read all of his works (though it should
                be noted that he only has four works, and they are all pretty short).

        <!--entry for crime and punishment-->
        <center><img src='photos/crime_punishment.jpg' id='book_cover'><center>
            <p id='books_subhead'><i>Crime and Punishment</i></p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Author: Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Published: 1866</p>
            <p id='book_body'>I actually tried to read this book twice. The first time, I made it about halfway
                through (fun fact: this book is 671 pages long, so you can see that I initially lost
                the 400+ page battle with this one). I picked the book back up again some time later
                and had no problems finishing it. It's a beautiful story (in a twisted way) and exemplifies
                all of the not-so-savory things we try to conceal about our human nature. Really beautiful
                book in this regard, and it was a fine introduction to Dostoevsky.

            <p id='books_subhead' style='text-align: left; font-size: 20px'>Published: 1886</p>
            <p id='book_body'>This was my first proper philosophical text. I don't really know
                what to say other than this book changed my life. I really don't know what to say
                other than that. It made me really love and appreciate life.
