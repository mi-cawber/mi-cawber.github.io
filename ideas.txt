Ideas:
1. figure out why the folder organization didn't work
2. add change-log
    -What do I mean by this?
    how was i going to do it
3. Make page for cool photos I have taken

Index:
1. I think maybe the entire page could be re-done, focus on presenting the other pages
    -get rid of the painting, fill with other content
2. change the background away from the stars


Music:
1. correctly align photos
    -try surrounding eras with divs
    -I know how to do it now. Question is, do I like the
    vertical sequence?
2. I want a page for pianists...
