Ideas:
1. figure out why the folder organization didn't work

Music:
1. correctly align photos
2. Instead of listing as "favorites," list them as
    "composers that have influenced me." I only listen
    to a few composers, but that doesn't mean I haven't
    been influenced by others.

Guiding Principles:
    1. Maintain Optimism
