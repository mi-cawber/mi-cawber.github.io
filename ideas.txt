Ideas:
1. figure out why the folder organization didn't work
2. add change-log

Index:
1. I think maybe the entire page could be re-done, focus on presenting the other pages



Music:
1. correctly align photos
    -try surrounding eras with divs
2. Instead of listing as "favorites," list them as
    "composers that have influenced me." I only listen
    to a few composers, but that doesn't mean I haven't
    been influenced by others.
3.
    -John Field
    -Johannes Brahms
    -CPE Bach
    -Franz Liszt
    -Wolfang Amadeus Mozart
    -Franz Schubert
    -Richard Wagner
4. I want a page for pianists...
