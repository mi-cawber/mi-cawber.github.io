 Fun website to learn html/css.

 It's a platform for self-expression so that I can learn myself better. I think maybe as we grow into adults, we feel as though
 we wake up one morning and completely know ourselves. Then, after this moment, we treat ourselves almost as static beings, as though our interests, opinions, values will forever remain fixed and unchanged.
 
I believe we must continually update our knowledge about ourselves and a good way to do this is by laying the contents of your mind before yourself and analyzing it.
