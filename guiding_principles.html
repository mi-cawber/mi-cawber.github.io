            <!--number one-->
            <p id='principle'>1. Each Person Is Worthwhile</p>
                <p id='p_body'>Without a doubt, you can learn something from every human being you meet 
                    in your life, if you really try. Everyone has something of value to say or add. Avoid
                    classifying people as "too stupid" or "too smart" or too this or too that. <i>We are all human
                        beings</i>, and I think often times we forget how deep the implications of this fact are.
                </p>

            <!--number two-->
            <p id='principle'>2. Embrace Loved Ones</p>
                <p id='p_body'>There seems to be fewer things more precious in life
                    than developing genuine bonds with the people around you in your daily
                    life. For many years, I didn't really seem to understand what it meant to
                    put a real, <i>focused</i> effort into such relationships. I just of just
                    assumed they happened or they didn't. I'm glad I can now experience what it is 
                    like to have people <i>close</i> to you. What is better than this?
                </p>

            <!--number three-->
            <p id='principle'>3. Enjoy The Moment</p>
                <p id='p_body'>Over the last couple of years I have become intrigued by the experienced
                    passage of time. At once, life seems as though it takes <i>forever</i> while also passing
                    by at breakneck speeds (have you ever thought about a particular event or something and thought, "That
                    happened <i>six months</i> ago?"). It has made me think about the inevitability of aging. It has made me 
                    think about the times when I have seen people in late adulthood who have seemingly spent their entire lives 
                    going through the motions. It is easy to think, "Well I'm glad that isn't me." But the thing is, life is indifferent,
                    and that could become any one of us. We only get one shot down here on Earth, so make it count. Look at the
                    sky every once in awhile!
                </p>

            <!--number four-->
            <p id='principle'>4. Be Curious</p>
                <p id='p_body'>I have come to learn that I get a particular thrill from learning something 
                    new, or placing myself as a complete beginner in any given domain. This seemingly inexhaustible reservoir
                    of curiosity is what I think people are referring to when they say things like "keep your youth," or "remain
                    as a child in adulthood." There is something so freeing about <i>never</i> being done with learning new things.
                </p>

            <!--number five-->
            <p id='principle'>5. Don't Fear Failure</p>
                <p id='p_body'>This is closely related with the former point. If someone finds the time, I would encourage
                    them to sit down and think about the pros and cons of either choosing a life of safety or choosing a life of risk
                    and adventure. The simple fact is, no matter which path you choose, you're going to die anyway. So why the heck
                    would you play it safe and boring, if it won't save you in the end anyway? Of course I think this mindset sort of
                    changes once one becomes married and has children or whatever. But, I think as young single person, you should try
                    to fail as much as possible--seriously. It can be kind of fun, and you learn a hell of a lot about yourself and 
                    what you're capable of along the way. How else are you gonna figure those things out?
                </p>

            <!--number six-->
            <p id='principle'>6. Be  Optimistic</p>
                <p id='p_body'>The world we live in is very cruel and unfair. This is simply true. However, it is best if we worry about
                    the things we can directly change, and we may come to learn that we can change a lot more than we think. Having the ability
                    to summon an optimistic view in the most critical situations seems to almost be a superpower.
