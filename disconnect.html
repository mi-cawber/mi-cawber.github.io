    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p class='body'>For 100 days I will be changing the way I interact with the internet, avoiding many of the platforms/features that prioritze maximizing engagement. Instead, I will adopt a more focused and intentional approach. <br></p>

    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p class='body'>This will run from <b>2/02/2026-5/13/2026</b>.

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p class='body'>This is an effort to question the assumptions that have been baked into our minds over the last 10-15 years. For example:</p> 

    <ol class='body'>
        <li>We are missing something important if we aren't constantly "checking" our social media accounts.</li><br>
        <li>Becoming addicted to inflammatory and emotionally manipulative news coverage is the duty of a responsible, "informed" citizen.</li><br>
        <li>The modern landscape of social media (recommedation algorithms, infinite scrolling) is inevitable and "just the way it is."</li><br>
    </ol>

    <p class='body'>I do not believe any of these assumptions to be true, and I believe we silently go along with them because we are flat-out addicted to these platforms and the way they are designed. Social media platforms were originally created to bring us closer to the people in our lives. They have strayed <i>so far</i> from this original purpose.</p>

    <p class='body'>I am curious what effects (if any) this approach will have on my attitudes, emotions, attention span, anxiety levels, etc. What does it feel like to be a normal human being who isn't exposed to crazy amounts of emotionally manipulative information 24/7?</p>

    <h2 style='color: white;'>What I will avoid in particular:</h2>
    <ol class='body'>
        <li><b><i>Passive usage of social platforms*:</b></i> I think it is one of those hard truths that we have to accept that passive use of social apps is a <b>pure waste of time</b> in >99.999% of instances.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b><i>Infinite scroll:</b></i> The philosophy behind this feature is that it increases the likelihood that you will stay on a platform for longer periods of time. It was never intended to benefit users in any way.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b><i>Recommendation algorithms:</b></i> I believe this feature began with good intentions. It makes sense to show people the kind of stuff they like to see. However, these algorithms have now been tuned to show you content that invokes powerful emotional responses (fear, anxiety, anger) because these have been proven to keep you on the platform for longer periods of time. The recommendation algorithms also create echo chambers and distort the user's perception of reality. Furthermore, the big companies are aware of this (they are the ones designing and implementing the algorithms, after all), but they do not care about the health of the user. Longer time spent on platform = more success for advertisers.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b><i>Short-form content:</b></i> TikTok brain. What more do I have to say?</li><br>

        <li><b><i>Political content:</b></i> Since 2016, we have seen mainstream media/news move away from objective reporting, instead choosing to push narratives and support ideologies. This has become so prevalent and obvious that it's almost comical. The most glaring example lies in the coverage of CNN and Fox News. They do not just report events, they report events through the lens of their own, opposite interpretations. What's funnier, both of these stations say <i>exactly what you think they would say</i>. They encourage a divided nation, they encourage hatred, they promote fear and uncertainty.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class='body'><i>*"No passive usage" for me means no visiting a site out of boredom just to scroll.</i></p>

    <h2>What's permitted, not permitted:</h2>

            <table class='table'>
                <!-- headers -->
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Permitted</b></td>
                    <td><b>Not Permitted</b></td>
                </tr>

                <!-- data -->
                <tr>
                    <td>YouTube*</td>
                    <td>News Outlets</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Podcasts</td>
                    <td>Social Platforms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Wikipedia</td>
                    <td>-</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

    <p class='body'><i>*Explicit video/channel searches are allowed. No use of homepage, recommended videos, etc. Fortunately, YouTube gives you the option to disable tracking your search history, which consequently gets rid of having a bunch of suggested videos on your homepage. I was really happy to learn this!</i></p>

    <p class=body>The items under "Not Permitted" should be viewed as all-encompassing rather than vague. When I say "News Outlets" I mean CNN, Fox, WSJ, anything you would think of as a news outlet. I will not visit these sites. I think they employ many of the same strategies as the social media comapanies to leverage reader emotions and keep them engaged. Plus, what's interesting about these sites (especially CNN and Fox) is that <i>they say exactly what you think they would say</i>, so it's like, what am I gaining from you? They promote ideologies and division more than they "report news." I think this is common knowledge these days. And when I say "Social Platforms" I mean Facebook, X, Instagram, Snapchat, anything you would view as a social platform.</p>

    <p class='body'>I also have some side goals as well, like limiting the amount of advertisements I see. This is very interesting because it makes you realize that ads are literally everywhere in civilized society and it is <i>extremely</i> difficult to avoid them unless you choose to sit at home and stare at the wall all day. Most of my exposure to ads comes when I am watching sports, which sucks because I like watching sports. I do already have adblockers on my computers, but I think they could be better. This is something I can work on during the challenge.</p>

    <h2>How will I track it?</h2>
    <p class='body'>I will make little entries about how it is going throughout the challenge. What seems hard, what seems better, just how it's going in general. I will also report moments where I fail and visit these sites (we must always assume a mistake will occur).
