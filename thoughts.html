            It is very interesting that we would consider staying in an amusement park for weeks on end to be silly, yet we indulge in the same sort of emotionally thrilling
            pleasures on our phones via social media all day, every day. Why is it still radical for someone to be skeptical of social media? Our world has experienced a boom in
            connectivity, and it is safe to say we will not revert to our previous circumstances (before social media). However, the habit of being chronically-online will not define
            humankind for the rest of its existence--this, too, will phase out. I wonder what will come next?

            Going on walks in the spring or summer acts as an amazing reset button. It is so amazing to feel the slight breeze, hear & watch the trees sway,
            look up into the sky. Wow! Even one hour doing this has such amazing effects!

            When one has spent a good portion of the day slacking off, watching shows or doing something else generally considered 'lazy,' it's easy to think that the day is wasted and you may
            as well wait until the next day to do anything. However, it is very interesting how much different a day can look and feel within a matter of hours. Even if it's 5:00pm, and you have
            done nothing all day, you can still turn around and do soemthing interesting or productive for another <i>four hours</i> and only have it be 9:00pm. It's refreshing to know that
            a day can always be salvaged.

            I started college a bit late, at twenty-two years old. I remember when I was thinking about quitting my (then) current job to attend
            university full-time, I was nervous because I knew it would take four years to complete, and that seemed like a long time
            when I was alreadt twenty-two.
            <br>
            I remember a particular conversation I had with my grandpa. It was a nice July day--
            the sun was out, there was a nice breeze, and we were just talking under a tree. I expressed these worries to him. After a pause,
            he looked at me and said, 'Four years is going to pass no matter what. It doesn't matter if you decide to go to college or not,
            the four years are going to pass no matter what. Would you prefer to have a degree four years from now, or have one?'
            <br>
            It was a remarkably simple but amazing point. It made me realize that is really does not matter 'how long something takes.' If you are curious
            about doing something, or wonder if something is possible, just go and try it. Just seriously go and do it.
            <br>
            I really believe that only by <i>doing</i> can we learn ourselves, those close to us, and the world around us.

            The most fascinating and beautiful thing about baseball to me is the fact that your chances of success
            every time you are at-bat are much lower than your chances of failure. Baseball is a game where you constantly
            fail, and the ability of the players to overcome their high likelihood of failure and to still dig out moments
            of success is very elegant and beautiful.

            As someone in their late twenties, interacting with or simply observing people in their later years
             is an almost surreal experience. They introduce the indifferent fact that one day, if I am lucky, 
             I will be their age. I will be old. Now I am young and ambitious, full of drive and equipped with 
             an inexhaustible tolerance for rejection and failure. How will I change in the following decades?

            There is nothing wrong with being yourself. If you don’t do things the way other
            people do them, if you don’t think about things the way other people do, if you don’t have
            the same reactions and interests as others—that’s okay. Don’t view yourself as the locus of
            the problem and think you must change. As a matter of fact, don’t view the situation as a problem
            at all. It is completely fine to be the way you are, and it is completely fine for others to be how
            they are as well.

            I work for my old chemistry lab supervisor on campus. A couple of weeks ago,
            we were talking, and she expressed being exhausted with the lack of effort
            she was seeing from many students. This is not uncommon for her,
            but at the end she said something really interesting that caught my attention.
            She said, "Students these days need to understand that not everything can be
            done in five minutes." This really struck a chord within me. I think a lot of us,
            given the world we are immersed in, expect quick results in all facets of our life.
            But the truth is, all things that are worth attaining cannot "be done in five minutes."
            It's inspiring, and reasssures me that steady, hard work toward meaningful goals
            will lead to success.
