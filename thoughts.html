                    I do worry about my fellow gen-z. We have grown up very distracted people. As a matter of fact, there is an argument to be made that we are the most distracted generation of human beings ever. I wonder how this will affect us?

		    Leather shoes and a well-fitted jacket does not automatically indicate refinement or respectability. I have met scoundrels vile in manner who were dressed to the nines, and I have met honorable men deserving of the utmost respect dressed in base clothing. If anything, the scoundrels often use sharp dress to disguise themselves.

                    There are moments when the brevity of life descends upon one like a mighty storm and becomes the sole occupant along the train of thought for quite some time. It is very difficult in these moments to maintain a matter-of-fact demeanor, it is difficult not to question every decision one has made up to that point, and every decision one will make after that point. I suppose this sobering self-awareness is merely a byproduct of our species' heightened cognition.

		    We certainly live in almost comical hypocrisy. We preach for equality for all, and yet target those we don't agree with. We speak ill of "wealthy," unless they align with our interests, or are entertainment figures. We think of public programs and resources that could enrich our communities, and yet football coaches of public universities get paid tens of millions of dollars. Our National Football League, the pride of all Americans, had a revenue of $21.2 billion for the 2024 season. Baseball star Juan Soto secured a $765 million deal with the New York Mets. Pop star Taylor Swift is worth $2.1 billion. The popular political streamer Hasan Piker, a self-proclaimed socialist, is worth over $10 million.<br><br> And still the common, everyday people among us will stand proudly behind these latter figures, with $5 in their back pocket, and hatred brewing in their heart.<br><br> Yes, especially as it concerns the trending social issues of the day, Americans live in a comical state of irony and hyprocrisy. I fear that we have lost our ability to think further than the current day.

                Social media culture has emphasized our tendency to position ourselves socially in favor of the majority. "I like this person, I don't like this person; this person is this, and that person is that." All in accordance with what we see the majority of others saying. "See? I feel the same way you do about everyone--I am one of you. We share morals, values, interests..." What is ironic is that the <i>majority of the majority</i> (which is what we see) are producing this same, reflexive behavior. Are we not in a situation where 90% echo the feelings of the 10% because the 90% feel as though this is what "everyone" thinks?

                Over the past decades we have become infatuated with computers and the amount
                of information they are able to process. In our infatuation, our imaginations have run
                wild, and we too wish to replicate this capacity for processing information. Introduce
                social media, which is nothing more than a funnel of information; and today, the
                funnel never runs dry. Did we ever stop to think about what the limitations are
                regarding the human's ability to process information effectively? Have we considered
                that we may be overclocking our brains with all of this text/image/video/audio
                information, and that it may be having an overall damaging effect on us as a system?

                It's interesting how much time we spend in our lives thinking about how we want certain things that we don't have
                and how much happier we would be if we had them. What's notable is that each time we end up getting one of those things,
                the relief we feel is short-lived, and we are back to wanting something else.

                And what do we find as an answer, when we ask about the meaning of life? Does not the common citizen reply with something similar to "happiness"? And
                is this all? Happiness? An emotional state? Surely this cannot be.

                And what of responsibility? Or understanding? Or emphasizing core principles? Is it American to turn the meaning of life inward, to seek one's own
                happiness? And where do others factor in? We like to consider ourselves as altruistic, and yet our very meaning of life does not have anything to do
                with anyone other than ourselves.

                I am even more confident in the idea presented in my 8/11 entry about perceiving one's character through how they talk about others. It seems that
                the more miserable a person is, the more time they will spend talking negatively about other people, or the more time they will spend being worried
                about the activities of others in the first place. The most pleasant and inspiring people I have ever encountered have shown a disinterest in petty
                gossip and do not derive pleasure from discussing the shortcomings of others.

                 Conversations and relationships in general are built upon shared context. For example, imagine if each time you interacted with your family member
                 or best friend, you had to introduce yourself fresh. The idea is absurd. So then, contexts are the vehicle for relationship development, and the
                 more context that is shared, the “closer” you begin to feel to another. However, I don’t believe a decently large context window ensures a strong
                 relationship—you can have much shared context with someone and yet despise them. But, to maintain a healthy, growing relationship, I think much care
                 should be taken in this regard.

                 <br><br>

                 And tell me, what good will it do to thrash the period you live within, to steep yourself in anger or hatred toward others and the world at large? 
                 We are each but a shallow breath in the eye of the universe, and indulging in such wretched behavior is only a sign of an immature mind.

                 <br><br>

                 Many think oneself may be known through observing the occasional trains of reflective thought that randomly ride through consciousness.
                 However, this may be equivalent to saying you know everything about a business by seeing its billboard on the highway. You may derive fundamental
                 concepts about the business, but hardly anything more.

                 I think we must speak to ourselves, write to ourselves, and tread through the insides of the train. If not, they are terribly fleeting.

                A behavior that illuminates one's character well is how often they spend talking negatively about other people vs. how often they spend talking positively 
                about other people--<i>or</i>, how often they spend simply not talking about others at all..

                It is interesting to stop and think about the many changes in values and attitudes that have anchored the young throughout the 21st century. Let's imagine you
                embodied all of them--what would you look like? You would work for a company, but hate your job and boss because they promote a sort of patriarchical system.
                So then you would be left working each day hating every second but not leaving because you must earn some money. Secondly, you would refuse all religious
                values and ideologies because these are also ancient patriarchical systems that don't have a place in today's society. Thirdly, you would hold dear the idea
                of hyper-independence; not in the sense of being able to take care of yourself, but embracing the mindset that <i>you do not need anyone else</i>. You would
                view most with suspicion and, if you were a woman, you would be highly skeptical of all men, remaining single into middle adulthood at least. Fourthly, since
                you had abandoned the religious value system, and since you are spending so much time alone (neglecting the fact that we are social creatures with social
                needs), you begin searching for something that will fill both of these voids simultaneously. Luckily, social media (where you will probably be spending most of
                your leisure time) has just the answer--<i>national politics</i>. Finally, a place where figures represent ideas and morals but are <i>not</i> anchored in
                religious fantasy, and a place where ceaseless debate occurs. The internet provides you a perfect place to express how everything you do and think is correct and
                why everything those who don't like do is <i>wrong</i>.<br>

                As I step back and look at this generalized caricature, I cannot say that I envy it. I cannot say that this direction is <i>progress</i>; as a matter of fact,
                it seems to be an illustration of a human that has haphazardly thrown to the side ideas and rituals that have propelled us through millenia. Nietzsche had said
                that nihilism was not itself a goal or and end, but a transition into a new set of beliefs and values. It would seem that <b>a)</b> many are using nihilism
                as their end, and <b>b)</b> we are not taking the time to critically think about what will propel us through further millenia.<br>

                I believe living for today will only get us so far.

                It is very easy to become irritated or overwhelmed in the face of a challenge. Being overwhelmed is more understandable than being irritated; it would seem
                to me that irritation in the face of a challenge reflects little more than insecurity. Actually, it may even be a mixture of pride and insecurity--in some sense,
                one can be almost insulted that the challenge would dare question your capability, in another sense, one secretly doubts if they can succeed. I think maybe this
                is what it means to be irritated by a challenge.<br>

                Whatever the case may be, it is more fruitful to not only accept challenges as they come with a jovial attitude, but it may even be beneficial to consistently
                seek them independently. This is truly easier said than done.

                One of the more thought-provoking things in calculus is the principle that a function may change its behavior
                rather suddenly as it approaches a value <i>x</i>. While the function previous to this value may be relatively predictable, the function
                can display novel behavior seemingly arbitrarily at such a point of interest.<br>
                I believe this applies to the behavior patterns of biological creatures as well. For example, we may drive 7 hours from Tennessee to Indiana, spending
                95% of the way simply listening to music, stopping to use the restroom, and so on. But, for the last 5%, sometimes we can get visibly antsy, maybe we start
                driving faster, rolling at stop signs, rolling windows up/down, etc. This of course is a generalization, but the main idea is that even us humans can exhibit
                novel behavior after a relatively predictable chain of behaviors as we approach some point <i>x</i>. Isn't that so interesting?

                I am convinced that the modern piano is the most emotionally effective instrument that has ever been developed by humankind.
                In addition to this, I am convinced that Chopin learned to exemplify this idea to the greatest extent so far in our history.

                I have a feeling that we are in 'the eleventh hour' concerning the way we consume social media currently.
                These platforms have changed a lot since their inception in the late 2000s/early 2010s. They began as a new, exciting
                way to connect with those you care about in life--this was their reason for existing. But, over the last 15 years, they have
                morped into monstrosities that exploit the human nervous system and generate endless revenue for advertisers and themselves.
                Even more menacingly, these companies have learned the power they wield in influencing human perception, which in turn influences
                the very shape of society. Nothing I am saying here is controversial--this is simple fact.

                Given this, it has always been strange to me that the population continues to latch onto these platforms. I think, in our digital world,
                we have convinced ourselves that social media giants are an inevitability and essentially there is nothing we can do about them. This is sad
                to me, and I do not believe social media represents an objective inevitability. I do not believe that this status-quo will persist for much
                longer. It makes me very curious to know what the landscape will look like ten years from now. Will people still cling to these platforms?
                Will people still destroy their internal reward systems by frying themselves on these platforms which have been designed to make interacting
                with them as emotionally-charged and addicting as possible? When will we refuse to be treated like hamsters? As it stands now, we welcome the
                treatment... but why?

                The idea of achievement/progress is very interesting. It seems that many people in modern society strive to
                have the feeling of achievement and progress, and they wonder what the formula is for attaining this. Sometimes
                people will cite drive, motivation, purpose, things like this. And while these things will fuel or contribute
                to these ends, I don't think they act as the causal element. What is interesting is, it seems as though the
                mechanism that actually propels one toward these ends is <i>consistency.</i> And plainly, that seems to be it.
                If something is done consistently, you will improve at it. It would simply appear to be the case that things like 
                drive, motivation, purpose act as agents which encourage persistence and consistency--but it is important to note that
                they themselves are <i>not</i> persistence and consistency.

                connectivity, and it is safe to say we will not revert to our previous circumstances (before social media). However, the habit of being chronically-online will not define

                When one has spent a good portion of the day slacking off, watching shows or doing something else generally considered 'lazy,' it's easy to think that the day is wasted and you may
                as well wait until the next day to do anything. However, it is very interesting how much different a day can look and feel within a matter of hours. Even if it's 5:00pm, and you have
                done nothing all day, you can still turn around and do soemthing interesting or productive for another <i>four hours</i> and only have it be 9:00pm. It's refreshing to know that
                a day can always be salvaged.

                I started college a bit late, at twenty-two years old. I remember when I was thinking about quitting my (then) current job to attend
                university full-time, I was nervous because I knew it would take four years to complete, and that seemed like a long time
                when I was alreadt twenty-two.
                <br>
                I remember a particular conversation I had with my grandpa. It was a nice July day--
                the sun was out, there was a nice breeze, and we were just talking under a tree. I expressed these worries to him. After a pause,
                he looked at me and said, 'Four years is going to pass no matter what. It doesn't matter if you decide to go to college or not,
                the four years are going to pass no matter what. Would you prefer to have a degree four years from now, or have one?'
                <br>
                It was a remarkably simple but amazing point. It made me realize that is really does not matter 'how long something takes.' If you are curious
                about doing something, or wonder if something is possible, just go and try it. Just seriously go and do it.
                <br>
                I really believe that only by <i>doing</i> can we learn ourselves, those close to us, and the world around us.

                The most fascinating and beautiful thing about baseball to me is the fact that your chances of success
                every time you are at-bat are much lower than your chances of failure. Baseball is a game where you constantly
                fail, and the ability of the players to overcome their high likelihood of failure and to still dig out moments
                of success is very elegant and beautiful.

                As someone in their late twenties, interacting with or simply observing people in their later years
                 is an almost surreal experience. They introduce the indifferent fact that one day, if I am lucky, 
                 I will be their age. I will be old. Now I am young and ambitious, full of drive and equipped with 
                 an inexhaustible tolerance for rejection and failure. How will I change in the following decades?

                There is nothing wrong with being yourself. If you don’t do things the way other
                people do them, if you don’t think about things the way other people do, if you don’t have
                the same reactions and interests as others—that’s okay. Don’t view yourself as the locus of
                the problem and think you must change. As a matter of fact, don’t view the situation as a problem
                at all. It is completely fine to be the way you are, and it is completely fine for others to be how
                they are as well.

                I work for my old chemistry lab supervisor on campus. A couple of weeks ago,
                we were talking, and she expressed being exhausted with the lack of effort
                she was seeing from many students. This is not uncommon for her,
                but at the end she said something really interesting that caught my attention.
                She said, "Students these days need to understand that not everything can be
                done in five minutes." This really struck a chord within me. I think a lot of us,
                given the world we are immersed in, expect quick results in all facets of our life.
                But the truth is, all things that are worth attaining cannot "be done in five minutes."
                It's inspiring, and reasssures me that steady, hard work toward meaningful goals
                will lead to success.
