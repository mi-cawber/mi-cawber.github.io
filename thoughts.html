            As someone in their late twenties, interacting with or simply observing people in their later years
             is an almost surreal experience. They introduce the indifferent fact that one day, if I am lucky, 
             I will be their age. I will be old. Now I am young and ambitious, full of drive and equipped with 
             an inexhaustible tolerance for rejection and failure. How will I change in the following decades?

            There is nothing wrong with being yourself. If you don’t do things the way other
            people do them, if you don’t think about things the way other people do, if you don’t have
            the same reactions and interests as others—that’s okay. Don’t view yourself as the locus of
            the problem and think you must change. As a matter of fact, don’t view the situation as a problem
            at all. It is completely fine to be the way you are, and it is completely fine for others to be how
            they are as well.

            I work for my old chemistry lab supervisor on campus. A couple of weeks ago,
            we were talking, and she expressed being exhausted with the lack of effort
            she was seeing from many students. This is not uncommon for her,
            but at the end she said something really interesting that caught my attention.
            She said, "Students these days need to understand that not everything can be
            done in five minutes." This really struck a chord within me. I think a lot of us,
            given the world we are immersed in, expect quick results in all facets of our life.
            But the truth is, all things that are worth attaining cannot "be done in five minutes."
            It's inspiring, and reasssures me that steady, hard work toward meaningful goals
            will lead to success.
