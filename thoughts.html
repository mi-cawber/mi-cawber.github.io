	    Over the past decades we have become infatuated with computers and the amount
	    of information they are able to process. In our infatuation, our imaginations have run
	    wild, and we too wish to replicate this capacity for processing information. Introduce
	    social media, which is nothing more than a funnel of information; and today, the
	    funnel never runs dry. Did we ever stop to think about what the limitations are
	    regarding the human's ability to process information effectively? Have we considered
	    that we may be overclocking our brains with all of this text/image/video/audio
	    information, and that it may be having an overall damaging effect on us as a system?
	</p>
	<p>
	    <b>9/27/25</b><br>
	    It's interesting how much time we spend in our lives thinking about how we want certain things that we don't have
	    and how much happier we would be if we had them. What's notable is that each time we end up getting one of those things,
	    the relief we feel is short-lived, and we are back to wanting something else.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <b>9/23/25</b><br>
	    And what do we find as an answer, when we ask about the meaning of life? Does not the common citizen reply with something similar to "happiness"? And
	    is this all? Happiness? An emotional state? Surely this cannot be.

	    And what of responsibility? Or understanding? Or emphasizing core principles? Is it American to turn the meaning of life inward, to seek one's own
	    happiness? And where do others factor in? We like to consider ourselves as altruistic, and yet our very meaning of life does not have anything to do
	    with anyone other than ourselves.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <b>9/21/25</b><br>
	    I am even more confident in the idea presented in my 8/11 entry about perceiving one's character through how they talk about others. It seems that
	    the more miserable a person is, the more time they will spend talking negatively about other people, or the more time they will spend being worried
	    about the activities of others in the first place. The most pleasant and inspiring people I have ever encountered have shown a disinterest in petty
	    gossip and do not derive pleasure from discussing the shortcomings of others.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <b>8/23/25</b><br>
	     Conversations and relationships in general are built upon shared context. For example, imagine if each time you interacted with your family member
	     or best friend, you had to introduce yourself fresh. The idea is absurd. So then, contexts are the vehicle for relationship development, and the
 	     more context that is shared, the “closer” you begin to feel to another. However, I don’t believe a decently large context window ensures a strong
	     relationship—you can have much shared context with someone and yet despise them. But, to maintain a healthy, growing relationship, I think much care
	     should be taken in this regard.

	     ---------------------------------------

	     And tell me, what good will it do to thrash the period you live within, to steep yourself in anger or hatred toward others and the world at large? 
	     We are each but a shallow breath in the eye of the universe, and indulging in such wretched behavior is only a sign of an immature mind.

	     ---------------------------------------

	     Many think oneself may be known through observing the occasional trains of reflective thought that randomly ride through consciousness.
	     However, this may be equivalent to saying you know everything about a business by seeing its billboard on the highway. You may derive fundamental
	     concepts about the business, but hardly anything more.

	     I think we must speak to ourselves, write to ourselves, and tread through the insides of the train. If not, they are terribly fleeting.

	    <b>8/12/25</b><br>
	    It is interesting to think about how often we have truly original thoughts, if at all. The irritating thing is, such a thing would be impossible to measure.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <b>8/11/25</b><br>
	    A behavior that illuminates one's character well is how often they spend talking negatively about other people vs. how often they spend talking positively 
	    about other people--<i>or</i>, how often they spend simply not talking about others at all..
	</p>
	<p>
            <b>8/8/25</b><br>
	    It is interesting to stop and think about the many changes in values and attitudes that have anchored the young throughout the 21st century. Let's imagine you
	    embodied all of them--what would you look like? You would work for a company, but hate your job and boss because they promote a sort of patriarchical system.
	    So then you would be left working each day hating every second but not leaving because you must earn some money. Secondly, you would refuse all religious
	    values and ideologies because these are also ancient patriarchical systems that don't have a place in today's society. Thirdly, you would hold dear the idea
	    of hyper-independence; not in the sense of being able to take care of yourself, but embracing the mindset that <i>you do not need anyone else</i>. You would
	    view most with suspicion and, if you were a woman, you would be highly skeptical of all men, remaining single into middle adulthood at least. Fourthly, since
	    you had abandoned the religious value system, and since you are spending so much time alone (neglecting the fact that we are social creatures with social
	    needs), you begin searching for something that will fill both of these voids simultaneously. Luckily, social media (where you will probably be spending most of
	    your leisure time) has just the answer--<i>national politics</i>. Finally, a place where figures represent ideas and morals but are <i>not</i> anchored in
	    religious fantasy, and a place where ceaseless debate occurs. The internet provides you a perfect place to express how everything you do and think is correct and
	    why everything those who don't like do is <i>wrong</i>.<br>

	    As I step back and look at this generalized caricature, I cannot say that I envy it. I cannot say that this direction is <i>progress</i>; as a matter of fact,
	    it seems to be an illustration of a human that has haphazardly thrown to the side ideas and rituals that have propelled us through millenia. Nietzsche had said
	    that nihilism was not itself a goal or and end, but a transition into a new set of beliefs and values. It would seem that <b>a)</b> many are using nihilism
	    as their end, and <b>b)</b> we are not taking the time to critically think about what will propel us through further millenia.<br>

	    I believe living for today will only get us so far.

            <strong>8/5/25</strong><br>
	    It is very easy to become irritated or overwhelmed in the face of a challenge. Being overwhelmed is more understandable than being irritated; it would seem
	    to me that irritation in the face of a challenge reflects little more than insecurity. Actually, it may even be a mixture of pride and insecurity--in some sense,
	    one can be almost insulted that the challenge would dare question your capability, in another sense, one secretly doubts if they can succeed. I think maybe this
	    is what it means to be irritated by a challenge.<br>

	    Whatever the case may be, it is more fruitful to not only accept challenges as they come with a jovial attitude, but it may even be beneficial to consistently
	    seek them independently. This is truly easier said than done.

            One of the more thought-provoking things in calculus is the principle that a function may change its behavior
            rather suddenly as it approaches a value <i>x</i>. While the function previous to this value may be relatively predictable, the function
            can display novel behavior seemingly arbitrarily at such a point of interest.<br>
            I believe this applies to the behavior patterns of biological creatures as well. For example, we may drive 7 hours from Tennessee to Indiana, spending
            95% of the way simply listening to music, stopping to use the restroom, and so on. But, for the last 5%, sometimes we can get visibly antsy, maybe we start
            driving faster, rolling at stop signs, rolling windows up/down, etc. This of course is a generalization, but the main idea is that even us humans can exhibit
            novel behavior after a relatively predictable chain of behaviors as we approach some point <i>x</i>. Isn't that so interesting?

            I am convinced that the modern piano is the most emotionally effective instrument that has ever been developed by humankind.
            In addition to this, I am convinced that Chopin learned to exemplify this idea to the greatest extent so far in our history.
            I have never heard music more beautiful than that from Chopin--especially the nocturnes, concertos, and ballades.

            <strong>6/25/25</strong><br>
            I have a feeling that we are in 'the eleventh hour' concerning the way we consume social media currently.
            These platforms have changed a lot since their inception in the late 2000s/early 2010s. They began as a new, exciting
            way to connect with those you care about in life--this was their reason for existing. But, over the last 15 years, they have
            morped into monstrosities that exploit the human nervous system and generate endless revenue for advertisers and themselves.
            Even more menacingly, these companies have learned the power they wield in influencing human perception, which in turn influences
            the very shape of society. Nothing I am saying here is controversial--this is simple fact.

            Given this, it has always been strange to me that the population continues to latch onto these platforms. I think, in our digital world,
            we have convinced ourselves that social media giants are an inevitability and essentially there is nothing we can do about them. This is sad
            to me, and I do not believe social media represents an objective inevitability. I do not believe that this status-quo will persist for much
            longer. It makes me very curious to know what the landscape will look like ten years from now. Will people still cling to these platforms?
            Will people still destroy their internal reward systems by frying themselves on these platforms which have been designed to make interacting
            with them as emotionally-charged and addicting as possible? When will we refuse to be treated like hamsters? As it stands now, we welcome the
            treatment... but why?

            The idea of achievement/progress is very interesting. It seems that many people in modern society strive to
            have the feeling of achievement and progress, and they wonder what the formula is for attaining this. Sometimes
            people will cite drive, motivation, purpose, things like this. And while these things will fuel or contribute
            to these ends, I don't think they act as the causal element. What is interesting is, it seems as though the
            mechanism that actually propels one toward these ends is <i>consistency.</i> And plainly, that seems to be it.
            If something is done consistently, you will improve at it. It would simply appear to be the case that things like 
            drive, motivation, purpose act as agents which encourage persistence and consistency--but it is important to note that
            they themselves are <i>not</i> persistence and consistency.

            There is so much human life on our planet—there is so much unique, interesting human life on our planet. 
            The same platter of celebrities and figures that is fed to us online is such a dilution of this idea.

            We all need to have something to live for. Even if one avoids the realm of the spiritual or looks down upon it with skepticism, one must still find a reason for living.
            Without it, seems as though it's hard to get up in the morning. Man's most painstakingly deliberated question is: <i>'why?'</i> The one word both eats us alive and
            grants us life.

            <strong>6/16/25</strong><br>
            It is very interesting that we would consider staying in an amusement park for weeks on end to be silly, yet we indulge in the same sort of emotionally thrilling
            pleasures on our phones via social media all day, every day. Why is it still radical for someone to be skeptical of social media? Our world has experienced a boom in
            connectivity, and it is safe to say we will not revert to our previous circumstances (before social media). However, the habit of being chronically-online will not define
            humankind for the rest of its existence--this, too, will phase out. I wonder what will come next?

            Going on walks in the spring or summer acts as an amazing reset button. It is so amazing to feel the slight breeze, hear & watch the trees sway,
            look up into the sky. Wow! Even one hour doing this has such amazing effects!

            When one has spent a good portion of the day slacking off, watching shows or doing something else generally considered 'lazy,' it's easy to think that the day is wasted and you may
            as well wait until the next day to do anything. However, it is very interesting how much different a day can look and feel within a matter of hours. Even if it's 5:00pm, and you have
            done nothing all day, you can still turn around and do soemthing interesting or productive for another <i>four hours</i> and only have it be 9:00pm. It's refreshing to know that
            a day can always be salvaged.

            I started college a bit late, at twenty-two years old. I remember when I was thinking about quitting my (then) current job to attend
            university full-time, I was nervous because I knew it would take four years to complete, and that seemed like a long time
            when I was alreadt twenty-two.
            <br>
            I remember a particular conversation I had with my grandpa. It was a nice July day--
            the sun was out, there was a nice breeze, and we were just talking under a tree. I expressed these worries to him. After a pause,
            he looked at me and said, 'Four years is going to pass no matter what. It doesn't matter if you decide to go to college or not,
            the four years are going to pass no matter what. Would you prefer to have a degree four years from now, or have one?'
            <br>
            It was a remarkably simple but amazing point. It made me realize that is really does not matter 'how long something takes.' If you are curious
            about doing something, or wonder if something is possible, just go and try it. Just seriously go and do it.
            <br>
            I really believe that only by <i>doing</i> can we learn ourselves, those close to us, and the world around us.

            The most fascinating and beautiful thing about baseball to me is the fact that your chances of success
            every time you are at-bat are much lower than your chances of failure. Baseball is a game where you constantly
            fail, and the ability of the players to overcome their high likelihood of failure and to still dig out moments
            of success is very elegant and beautiful.

            As someone in their late twenties, interacting with or simply observing people in their later years
             is an almost surreal experience. They introduce the indifferent fact that one day, if I am lucky, 
             I will be their age. I will be old. Now I am young and ambitious, full of drive and equipped with 
             an inexhaustible tolerance for rejection and failure. How will I change in the following decades?

            There is nothing wrong with being yourself. If you don’t do things the way other
            people do them, if you don’t think about things the way other people do, if you don’t have
            the same reactions and interests as others—that’s okay. Don’t view yourself as the locus of
            the problem and think you must change. As a matter of fact, don’t view the situation as a problem
            at all. It is completely fine to be the way you are, and it is completely fine for others to be how
            they are as well.

            I work for my old chemistry lab supervisor on campus. A couple of weeks ago,
            we were talking, and she expressed being exhausted with the lack of effort
            she was seeing from many students. This is not uncommon for her,
            but at the end she said something really interesting that caught my attention.
            She said, "Students these days need to understand that not everything can be
            done in five minutes." This really struck a chord within me. I think a lot of us,
            given the world we are immersed in, expect quick results in all facets of our life.
            But the truth is, all things that are worth attaining cannot "be done in five minutes."
            It's inspiring, and reasssures me that steady, hard work toward meaningful goals
            will lead to success.
