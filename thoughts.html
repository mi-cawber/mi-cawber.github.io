                    Maybe I am pretty harsh when it comes to cursive. I would be pretty upset is someone asked me not to write in cursive, I'm not sure why. I feel like it's not very much different than print. I mean, `f` and and `s` are the only lower-case letters I can think of that look kind of different. And it would take about 10 minutes to learn `G`, `H`, and `T` (`G` is the only one that really looks that different from print). I dunno, I feel like there isn't much of a valid argument when it comes to telling someone they shouldn't write in cursive.

I think it would be really interesting to do a challenge where you completely cut yourself off from social media, news outlets, advertisements, etc. What would it be like? It would require some planning and some effort for sure, especially if you wanted to avoid advertisements. I swear, ads can be just as bad as social media and the news.

                    Recently, I have began to appreciate more that true understanding and mastery can only be earned through repetition. Re-reading books, dedicating brain power to the same problems over and over again. As my old instructor used to say, "kids nowadays think that everything can be done in five minutes." She is right, we do think that, and it's a false assumption.<br>
                    All my life, concerning academic matters, I have thought I must be too stupid to understand something if I don't intuitively grasp a concept when <i>first</i> reading about it. For some reason, I really believed that everything that is true should <i>make sense</i> upon discovery. And I must say, there are really a lot of things that just make sense. However, this assumption was tested when I began to encounter advanced STEM material in undergrad. I would read about concepts in chemistry or physics that really just failed to make sense at the end of the first pass. This was very discouraging, and I thought I must be dumb. I thought I must be an imposter, that surely if I were as smart as people had told me in the past, something like this would be easy to understand. I am done with that sort of thinking. As I enter into my CS grad program next Monday, I know that this habit of thought can only destroy me. Hard material is just hard. You must fight with it in your mind. You must think about it over longer periods of time. You must really <i>try</i> to understand it. You have to truly <i>seek</i> an understanding. It will come to you with effort. There is no material that is too hard for the average person to understand--all that is required is time and effort.

Are we <i>better</i> off by spending so much time watching shows, movies, or sports, or playing video games? Must we accept that it is all self-indulgence? Have we become too successful a society? I don't know. I read about great men from the 1800s or even the 1900s, and it makes me realize that we don't have as many people like them anymore. Wow, I can't think about it too much, or it becomes really depressing.

We have subverted our own traditions and our Christian roots, and for what? I'm not a very religious person, but it is strange to see a country and culture reject itself.

                    <b>12/23/25</b><br>The modern West's most recent attempt to "end" racism was nothing less than a movement wherein racism was employed against the white man. There was never any intention to embrace equal opportunity or anything of the sort. And white women, half-shielded because of their status as women (but still guilty of being white), surrendered themselves as sacrificial lambs to this movement as a sort of self-defense mechanism. I think this period will be looked upon with interest by historians later in the future.

                    I am tired of recommendation algorithms. I already do not have accounts on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook. The social media site I use the most is YouTube. I must tip my hat to Google for implementing a setting which should be available by default on all social networks: the ability to remove the algorithm for YouTube. I was really surprised to see them give users this option, considering they won't even let users disable their AI overview on searches (which drove me to use DuckDuckGo instead). Anyway, I am looking forward to being able to use YouTube without the recommendation algorithm. You know, I'm just ready to experience life like a normal person. I am just flat-out tired of companies employing malicious strategies to maximize engagement and screen time. It wasn't always like this (obviously), and I'm not going to <b>waste</b> my one life on this planet being sucked into dumbass content on the internet. If that makes me weird, I don't really care.

                <b>12/17/25</b><br>I think social media platforms were destroyed by the coupling of recommendation algorithms and infinite scrolling. Newer users may not remember the time when these platforms <i>didn't</i> have these features. They felt entirely different. They felt more authentic--it felt like the user had more control. Can we imagine a world where the power is given to the user once again?

                A fleeting perspective about AI usage in workflows: People adopting AI tools to essentially vibe code for them are trying to generate (no pun intended) a bunch of coping arguments to justify themselves and attempt to place themselves as ahead of the curve. Just look on LinkedIn for three seconds. "AI isn't replacing developers, it's replacing developers who are afraid to use it." "AI doesn't replace analytical thinking, it <i>amplifies</i> it." I saw a post wherein someone was describing their "tools for data analysis," here was their stack: Cursor, Claude Code, Replit, Gamma, Microsoft Copilot. I'm sorry, but this is laughable. Please tell me I'm not crazy?

                    The judgement of what is worthwhile as an activity or hobby is contingent upon each individual. I don't believe there are absolute terms to speak of when confronting the meaning of life. To paraphrase Viktor Frankl: we shouldn't sit and ask life about its meaning. Instead, we should answer the questions that incessantly presents to us.<br>
                    For me, I just prefer going to bed each night knowing that I tried to make progress in some sort of way that <i>I</i> view as meaningful. This eases my mind. However, something that I think is important or meaningful may seem pointless or dull to another (and vice versa). There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not render inadequate either of our personal definitions of meaning.

                    It is very unpleasant that Google does not allow users to disable its obnoxious AI overview. These days, users have less and less control over how they interact with the internet.<br>
It is a bit corny, but I am going to start trying alternative search engines.<br>
You know, I just can't help but to recognize that early computing/web pioneers did not want the power of these systems to be consolidated into the hands of a few companies. Google is worth $3 trillion and its share of the global search engine market is ~90%. Microsoft is worth over $3.5 trillion and the Windows operating system has over 70% market share for desktop computuers. Meta is worth ~$1.6 trillion and Facebook has over 3 billion active users monthly. These companies have made fortunes in part by exploiting their users and their data. I am exhausted with these companies.

                    News outlets, influencers, streamers, YouTubers... there are so many different people and platforms on the internet which try to tell us <i>what</i> is important, <i>how</i> we should feel about it, and what kind of <i>action</i> or response would be necessary as a consequence. Just stop and think about that. And think about how much worse it has gotten over the last ten years or so. I believe social media may have been created with pure intentions in mind, but it didn't take long for the powers at be to recognize how social media could be used to further their aims. These platforms were created to simply connect people. Now, they companies have steered the platform experience toward maximum engagement in favor of advertisers.<br>
I am tired of having people on the internet tell me what I should think is important, what I should think about it, and how I should act upon it.

                    There are moments when the brevity of life descends upon one like a mighty storm and becomes the sole occupant along the train of thought for quite some time. It is very difficult in these moments to maintain a matter-of-fact demeanor, it is difficult not to question every decision one has made up to that point, and every decision one will make after that point. I suppose this sobering self-awareness is merely a byproduct of our species' heightened cognition.

We speak ill of "wealthy," unless they align with our interests, or are entertainment figures. We think of public programs and resources that could enrich our communities, and yet football coaches of public universities get paid tens of millions of dollars. Our National Football League, the pride of all Americans, had a revenue of $21.2 billion for the 2024 season. Baseball star Juan Soto secured a $765 million deal with the New York Mets. Pop star Taylor Swift is worth $2.1 billion. The popular political streamer Hasan Piker, a self-proclaimed socialist, is worth over $10 million.<br><br> And still the common, everyday people among us will stand proudly behind these latter figures, with $5 in their back pocket, and hatred brewing in their heart.<br><br> Yes, especially as it concerns the trending social issues of the day, Americans live in a comical state of irony and hyprocrisy.

                Social media culture has emphasized our tendency to position ourselves socially in favor of the majority. "I like this person, I don't like this person; this person is this, and that person is that." All in accordance with what we see the majority of others saying. "See? I feel the same way you do about everyone--I am one of you. We share morals, values, interests..." What is ironic is that the <i>majority of the majority</i> (which is what we see) are producing this same, reflexive behavior.

                 Conversations and relationships in general are built upon shared context. For example, imagine if each time you interacted with your family member
                 or best friend, you had to introduce yourself fresh. The idea is absurd. So then, contexts are the vehicle for relationship development, and the
                 more context that is shared, the “closer” you begin to feel to another. However, I don’t believe a decently large context window ensures a strong
                 relationship—you can have much shared context with someone and yet despise them. But, to maintain a healthy, growing relationship, I think much care
                 should be taken in this regard.

                 <br><br>

                 And tell me, what good will it do to thrash the period you live within, to steep yourself in anger or hatred toward others and the world at large? 
                 We are each but a shallow breath in the eye of the universe, and indulging in such wretched behavior is only a sign of an immature mind.

                 Many think oneself may be known through observing the occasional trains of reflective thought that randomly ride through consciousness.
                 However, this may be equivalent to saying you know everything about a business by seeing its billboard on the highway. You may derive fundamental
                 concepts about the business, but hardly anything more.

                 I think we must speak to ourselves, write to ourselves, and tread through the insides of the train. If not, they are terribly fleeting.

                It is interesting to think about how often we have truly original thoughts, if at all. The irritating thing is, such a thing would be impossible to measure.

                A behavior that illuminates one's character well is how often they spend talking negatively about other people vs. how often they spend talking positively 
                about other people--<i>or</i>, how often they spend simply not talking about others at all..

                It is interesting to stop and think about the many changes in values and attitudes that have anchored the young throughout the 21st century. Let's imagine you
                embodied all of them--what would you look like? You would work for a company, but hate your job and boss because they promote a sort of patriarchical system.
                So then you would be left working each day hating every second but not leaving because you must earn some money. Secondly, you would refuse all religious
                values and ideologies because these are also ancient patriarchical systems that don't have a place in today's society. Thirdly, you would hold dear the idea
                of hyper-independence; not in the sense of being able to take care of yourself, but embracing the mindset that <i>you do not need anyone else</i>. You would
                view most with suspicion and, if you were a woman, you would be highly skeptical of all men, remaining single into middle adulthood at least. Fourthly, since
                you had abandoned the religious value system, and since you are spending so much time alone (neglecting the fact that we are social creatures with social
                needs), you begin searching for something that will fill both of these voids simultaneously. Luckily, social media (where you will probably be spending most of
                your leisure time) has just the answer--<i>national politics</i>. Finally, a place where figures represent ideas and morals but are <i>not</i> anchored in
                religious fantasy, and a place where ceaseless debate occurs. The internet provides you a perfect place to express how everything you do and think is correct and
                why everything those who don't like do is <i>wrong</i>.<br>

                As I step back and look at this generalized caricature, I cannot say that I envy it. I cannot say that this direction is <i>progress</i>; as a matter of fact,
                it seems to be an illustration of a human that has haphazardly thrown to the side ideas and rituals that have propelled us through millenia. Nietzsche had said
                that nihilism was not itself a goal or and end, but a transition into a new set of beliefs and values. It would seem that <b>a)</b> many are using nihilism
                as their end, and <b>b)</b> we are not taking the time to critically think about what will propel us through further millenia.<br>

                I believe living for today will only get us so far.

                It is very easy to become irritated or overwhelmed in the face of a challenge. Being overwhelmed is more understandable than being irritated; it would seem
                to me that irritation in the face of a challenge reflects little more than insecurity. Actually, it may even be a mixture of pride and insecurity--in some sense,
                one can be almost insulted that the challenge would dare question your capability, in another sense, one secretly doubts if they can succeed. I think maybe this
                is what it means to be irritated by a challenge.<br>

                Whatever the case may be, it is more fruitful to not only accept challenges as they come with a jovial attitude, but it may even be beneficial to consistently
                seek them independently. This is truly easier said than done.

                One of the more thought-provoking things in calculus is the principle that a function may change its behavior
                rather suddenly as it approaches a value <i>x</i>. While the function previous to this value may be relatively predictable, the function
                can display novel behavior seemingly arbitrarily at such a point of interest.<br>
                I believe this applies to the behavior patterns of biological creatures as well. For example, we may drive 7 hours from Tennessee to Indiana, spending
                95% of the way simply listening to music, stopping to use the restroom, and so on. But, for the last 5%, sometimes we can get visibly antsy, maybe we start
                driving faster, rolling at stop signs, rolling windows up/down, etc. This of course is a generalization, but the main idea is that even us humans can exhibit
                novel behavior after a relatively predictable chain of behaviors as we approach some point <i>x</i>. Isn't that so interesting?

                I am convinced that the modern piano is the most emotionally effective instrument that has ever been developed by humankind.
                In addition to this, I am convinced that Chopin learned to exemplify this idea to the greatest extent so far in our history.
                I have never heard music more beautiful than that from Chopin--especially the nocturnes, concertos, and ballades.

                I have a feeling that we are in 'the eleventh hour' concerning the way we consume social media currently.
                These platforms have changed a lot since their inception in the late 2000s/early 2010s. They began as a new, exciting
                way to connect with those you care about in life--this was their reason for existing. But, over the last 15 years, they have
                morped into monstrosities that exploit the human nervous system and generate endless revenue for advertisers and themselves.
                Even more menacingly, these companies have learned the power they wield in influencing human perception, which in turn influences
                the very shape of society. Nothing I am saying here is controversial--this is simple fact.

                Given this, it has always been strange to me that the population continues to latch onto these platforms. I think, in our digital world,
                we have convinced ourselves that social media giants are an inevitability and essentially there is nothing we can do about them. This is sad
                to me, and I do not believe social media represents an objective inevitability. I do not believe that this status-quo will persist for much
                longer. It makes me very curious to know what the landscape will look like ten years from now. Will people still cling to these platforms?
                Will people still destroy their internal reward systems by frying themselves on these platforms which have been designed to make interacting
                with them as emotionally-charged and addicting as possible? When will we refuse to be treated like hamsters? As it stands now, we welcome the
                treatment... but why?

                The idea of achievement/progress is very interesting. It seems that many people in modern society strive to
                have the feeling of achievement and progress, and they wonder what the formula is for attaining this. Sometimes
                people will cite drive, motivation, purpose, things like this. And while these things will fuel or contribute
                to these ends, I don't think they act as the causal element. What is interesting is, it seems as though the
                mechanism that actually propels one toward these ends is <i>consistency.</i> And plainly, that seems to be it.
                If something is done consistently, you will improve at it. It would simply appear to be the case that things like 
                drive, motivation, purpose act as agents which encourage persistence and consistency--but it is important to note that
                they themselves are <i>not</i> persistence and consistency.

                We all need to have something to live for. Even if one avoids the realm of the spiritual or looks down upon it with skepticism, one must still find a reason for living.
                Without it, seems as though it's hard to get up in the morning. Man's most painstakingly deliberated question is: <i>'why?'</i> The one word both eats us alive and
                grants us life.

                It is very interesting that we would consider staying in an amusement park for weeks on end to be silly, yet we indulge in the same sort of emotionally thrilling
                pleasures on our phones via social media all day, every day. Why is it still radical for someone to be skeptical of social media? Our world has experienced a boom in
                connectivity, and it is safe to say we will not revert to our previous circumstances (before social media). However, the habit of being chronically-online will not define
                humankind for the rest of its existence--this, too, will phase out. I wonder what will come next?

                When one has spent a good portion of the day slacking off, watching shows or doing something else generally considered 'lazy,' it's easy to think that the day is wasted and you may
                as well wait until the next day to do anything. However, it is very interesting how much different a day can look and feel within a matter of hours. Even if it's 5:00pm, and you have
                done nothing all day, you can still turn around and do soemthing interesting or productive for another <i>four hours</i> and only have it be 9:00pm. It's refreshing to know that
                a day can always be salvaged.

                I started college a bit late, at twenty-two years old. I remember when I was thinking about quitting my (then) current job to attend
                university full-time, I was nervous because I knew it would take four years to complete, and that seemed like a long time
                when I was alreadt twenty-two.
                <br>
                I remember a particular conversation I had with my grandpa. It was a nice July day--
                the sun was out, there was a nice breeze, and we were just talking under a tree. I expressed these worries to him. After a pause,
                he looked at me and said, 'Four years is going to pass no matter what. It doesn't matter if you decide to go to college or not,
                the four years are going to pass no matter what. Would you prefer to have a degree four years from now, or have one?'
                <br>
                It was a remarkably simple but amazing point. It made me realize that is really does not matter 'how long something takes.' If you are curious
                about doing something, or wonder if something is possible, just go and try it. Just seriously go and do it.
                <br>
                I really believe that only by <i>doing</i> can we learn ourselves, those close to us, and the world around us.

                I work for my old chemistry lab supervisor on campus. A couple of weeks ago,
                we were talking, and she expressed being exhausted with the lack of effort
                she was seeing from many students. This is not uncommon for her,
                but at the end she said something really interesting that caught my attention.
                She said, "Students these days need to understand that not everything can be
                done in five minutes." This really struck a chord within me. I think a lot of us,
                given the world we are immersed in, expect quick results in all facets of our life.
                But the truth is, all things that are worth attaining cannot "be done in five minutes."
                It's inspiring, and reasssures me that steady, hard work toward meaningful goals
